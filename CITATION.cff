abstract: "This repository houses the computational framework and comprehensive analysis developed for a Master's thesis 
in Bioinformatics. The research focuses on critically examining the universality principle of the pan-mammalian epigenetic clocks, a key 
concept in the field of aging biology. Through statistical analyses and computational approaches, this 
work challenges existing paradigms and explores the tissue-specific nature of epigenetic aging markers. The repository 
includes custom Python scripts, R notebooks, and data processing pipelines designed to interrogate methylation 
datasets across diverse tissue types. This research contributes to the ongoing scientific discourse on the 
mechanisms of biological aging and the development of more accurate, context-specific epigenetic biomarkers."
